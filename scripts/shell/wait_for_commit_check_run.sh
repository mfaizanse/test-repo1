# This script waits for git check to completed.
# There are two types of git statuses i.e. check runs and statuses.
# For more information, see # https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks#types-of-status-checks-on-github

# Required env variables:
# - GH_TOKEN                       - GitHub token for gh CLI.
# - REPOSITORY_FULL_NAME           - Repository name including owner name e.g. kyma-project/kyma-companion.
# - GIT_REF                        - Git reference to check for the check run (i.e. commit sha, branch name or tag name).
# - GIT_CHECK_RUN_NAME             - Name of the git check to wait for.
# - INTERVAL                       - Interval in seconds to wait before check the status again.
# - TIMEOUT                        - Timeout in seconds to wait for the check run to complete before failing.
